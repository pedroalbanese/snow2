SNOW 2.0 Stream Cipher in Pure Go 

SNOW 2.0 is a synchronous stream cipher designed for high-speed software encryption. It combines a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) over the finite field GF(2¹⁶) with a Finite State Machine (FSM) to generate a secure pseudorandom keystream. The cipher supports key lengths of 128 or 256 bits and produces output that can be XORed with plaintext for encryption, providing strong resistance against known cryptanalytic attacks while remaining efficient for modern processors. SNOW 2.0 is standardized in ISO/IEC 18033-4:2011.
